# Auto Insurance Churn Analysis
The Capstone Project for Data Analytics program at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), Calgary, AB, Dec 2023

This project analyzes auto insurance customer churn using predictive modelling tchiques. 

## Documentation Contents

### 1. Data Dictionary

A list and description of the files relevant to this project can be found in this [Document](https://github.com/Weidsn/capstone_project/blob/main/Readme.txt). 

## 2. Data Wrangling

Raw data was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/merishnasuwal/auto-insurance-churn-analysis-dataset?select=autoinsurance_churn.csv), which contains over 1.6 million artificially generated records.

The raw dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Link to the Data Cleaning code can be found [here](https://github.com/Weidsn/capstone_project/blob/main/data_cleaning_group2.py).

### 3. Training Predictive Models

A number of techniques were used to train models that aim to predict customer churn. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Tree and Logisitic Regression were amoung the techniques employed.

My codes for training [Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](https://github.com/Weidsn/capstone_project/blob/main/ChurnAnalysis.py) models. 

### 4. Evaluating the Models
During the training sessions, underperforming models were discarded. Promising models underwent more detailed evaluation. 

Below is the list of models that were evaluated.
